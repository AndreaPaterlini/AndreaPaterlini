### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 

My name is Andrea Paterlini and I'm a molecular biologist. The biological system I focus on, that of plants, is of fundamental importance for food security, ecology and climate regulation. My particular area of interest is plasmodesmata, the small channels that connect plant cells and control cell-cell transport and signalling between them.

Here on github you will find some computational biology tools I developed, using the R programming language.
